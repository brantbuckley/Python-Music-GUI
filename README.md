# Python-Music-GUI
I wanted to create a program where musicians can enter in a major scale and relative minor scale through the GUI. The major scale, 
major scale chords, relative minor scale, and relative minor scale chords are displayed. For example, if you want data for the
key of C, the user enters in C in the major scale box and the relative minor scale box. The C major and minor scales are displayed 
along with the major and minor chords as well as the notes that make up each chord. All 12 keys are accessible. This solves a huge
problem as memorizing scales and the notes that make up chords takes a lot of time, practice, and dedication.
